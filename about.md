Hi there! :wave:

I am currently the Lead Robotics Software Engineer with the Dallas, TX R&D
division of [Bastian Solutions](https://www.bastiansolutions.com/), a Toyota
Advanced Logistics company. My professional interests are control theory,
kinematics, robotic software architecture, and warehouse automation. This
website catalogs some of my personal and academic projects â€” I hope you find
them interesting.
