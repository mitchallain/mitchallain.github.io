# MEEN 364 - Dynamic Systems and Controls

_I created this page while I was a teaching assistant at Texas A&M for MEEN 364,
Dynamic Systems and Controls. It has been preserved in its original form._

I have setup this page to provide helpful resources to anyone who is interested,
and I will occassionally add more as I come across them. None of these links are
required reading, but sometimes seeing the material presented in a different
format can help with understanding. These are some of the videos, websites, and
PDFs that helped me learn dynamic systems and controls. Enjoy!

## Supplemental Material

Here are some supplemental resources which support MEEN 364. Each bulleted item
contains a link which will take you to an external page.

### Introductory Control Systems

- [An excellent YouTube series on control theory by controls engineer/legend Brian Douglas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk).
  If you are struggling with any class concepts, there is a good chance they are
  covered on Brian's channel. The 46 videos in this playlist average about 12
  minutes a video and over 100,000 views each.
- [MATLAB and Simulink based controls tutorials](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?aux=Home)
  developed by professors at the University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon.
  Covers six dynamic systems through the modeling, analysis, and controller
  design phase.
- [MathWorks Control System Toolbox documentation](http://www.mathworks.com/help/control/index.html).
  One of the reasons MATLAB is preferred for control system design (especially
  in education) is the quality of the documentation and examples on the
  MathWorks website.

### MATLAB/Simulink

- [This `.m` file](https://mitchallain.github.io/misc/startup.m) sets the
  graphics defaults for MATLAB. It will execute on start-up if placed in the
  MATLAB path (type 'path' into MATLAB to list the search path).
- [How to draw ODEs in Simulink](http://blogs.mathworks.com/simulink/2008/05/23/how-to-draw-odes-in-simulink/#),
  by Guy Rouleau from MathWorks.

### Bode Diagrams

- A series of videos on understanding Bode plots by MathWorks engineer Carlos
  Osorio. Carlos discusses some real world systems and their frequency response
  characteristics using Bode diagrams. Four parts, 26 minutes total.
- Another series of Bode plot videos by MathWorks engineer Carlos Osorio. Carlos
  discusses using Bode plots to design lead/lag controllers. Very useful for
  understanding basic controller structure. Five parts, 33 minutes total. Other

### Controls Resources

These are meant to inform and inspire, if you're interested in the field of
controls engineering.

- [Latest robotics articles from the MIT Technology Review.](https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/robots/)
- [The Control Engineering Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Control-Engineering)
  page has some good Q&As about what controls engineers do now, and the future
  of the industry.
- [Robotics Stack Exhange](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/). Create a profile
  and ask questions, you'll be surprised by the quality and quantity of the
  answers you will get.
